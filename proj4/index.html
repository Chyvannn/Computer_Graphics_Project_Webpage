		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project, we implemented a physical real-time simulator to simulate the physical effects of cloth. In part 1, we
			setup a grid of point mass and springs to be used in the later parts. In part 2, we will apply the net force onto the
			point of mass, update the position of each point mass so that the cloth model can act based its position and force. In
			part 3, we handle the collision of the cloth model with sphere and plane to simulate the cloth falling on other objects.
			In part 4, we add the support to the self-collision of the cloth model so that we can simulate the scenario of cloth
			falling on itself. Finally, in part 5, we implement different types of shaders to give different effects to the cloth. A
			more detailed explaintion will be included in each parts.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project let us break a contiguous cloth to a collection points and simple spings so that we can process each
			element of the cloth independently by applying physical rules to cloth model. From this project, we think it is possible
			to extend the model into different objects, for instance, water and smoke, but the spring grip may be different from the
			cloth.
		</p>
		<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<p>
			For this part, we first calculate the steps in x and y/z coordinates. Since the number of points is 1 more than the
			number of grids, we divided the width and height by the number of point - 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			If cloth is horizantally oriented, the cloth is in the xz plane. Thus, we iterate through the z and x coordinate in a
			nested loop. For each position, we check if the position is contained in pinned and pass the bool to PointMass. x, z
			values in the Vector3D are set to step * current point index, and y is set to 1 respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			If cloth is vertically oriented, the cloth is in the xy plane. Thus, we iterate through the y and x coordinate in a
			nested loop. For each position, assign the bool value according to the position in pinned vector. x, y values are set to
			step * current point index, and z is set to a random value from -1/1000 to 1/1000 respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			To add springs, starting from the first point mass we added in the previous steps, we check if the left and above point
			mass exist. For structural constraints, the point of mass above is at index of [current_index - number of width], the
			left point of mass is [current_index - 1]. For shearing constraints, the point of mass to at the upper left position is
			at index of [current_index - number of width - 1], at the bottom right is at [current_index - number of width + 1]. For
			bending constraints, two points above is [current_index - 2 * number of width], at left is [current_index - 2].

		<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In this part, we implemented the physical effects to the cloth model to simulate the real motions of the cloth.</li>
			<li>
				The first step we did is to calcuate the total force of applied on each point of mass. The net force can be break into
				two parts, external force and internal force. To calculate the external force, we will use Newtowns' 2nd Law, F = ma. We
				already know external_acceleration. Thus, we will iterate through the point masses and for each point mass, we will
				initialize the net force vector to 0 and apply all accelerations to this point mass. We then apply the spring correction
				force based on Hooke's Law.
			</li>
			<li>
				For each spring in springs, we will check if the current constraint is enabled and if the spring type matches with the
				enabled constaint. If so, we will first get the position of two endpoint point masses of the spring, calculate the
				direction vector, then calculate the scalar value of the force multiply by the direction vector. If the constraint type
				is bending, we will multiply an extra 0.2 since bending constrain is the weakest one. We then apply Verlet integration
				on each unpinned point mass to calculate the position of the point mass at t = t + dt based on last_position,
				acceleration ], and current position.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, we will check if the springs have any unreasonable deformation. For each spring, we will first get both
				endpoint point masses and calculate the direction vector, midpoint of the spring, and the total deformed length. If the
				deformed length is greater then 1.1 * rest_length, we will do some correction to the spring. If neither endpoint is
				pinned, we will move both endpoint point masses towards the spring's midpoint by half of 1.1 * rest_length. If only one
				point is pinned, we will apply all the correction to the unpinned side. If neither point masses is unpinned, we will
				just skip this spring.
			</li>
			<li>
				By combinnning all these parts, we will be able to stimulate the scene of a cloth hanging with 2 pinned corner.
			</li>

		</div>
		<p>
			Changing ks will change the spring correction forces applied on each point mass. With higher ks, larger force will be
			applied given the same deformation. Starting at low ks, after we change it to a large value, we can see the cloth
			bounches once. With low ks, the cloth is more loose comparing with high ks

		</div>
		<p>
			Changing density will let the cloth have more net gravity force. Thus, when the cloth is hanging on the wall, the cloth
			will be pull further away from the rest position. When we change density from low to high, we can see that the cloth
			also bounces. WIth low density, the cloth is more unstable as we see in our rendering result with some relatively
			unclear parts.

		</div>
		<p>
			Changing damping will change how the motion of the cloth. With higher damping value, we can see that the cloth is more
			resistant to the forces applied on it. It will take a longer time for the cloth of reach the rest position. The cloth
			will also be harder to reach the rest position as in normal damping value scenario. For small value, the cloth will
			quickly reach the lowest position and the cloth will also keep swinging like silk, the overall feeling is that the cloth
			is more soft and thin than the high damping value one.

		<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>
			To implement Sphere::collide, we first get a path vector from origin of the sphere to point mass position. If the norm
			of this vector is smaller than the radius of the sphere, the point mass collide with the sphere and we will need to move
			the point mass out to the surface of the sphere. The tangent point is calculated using the origin plus the direction of
			the path vector * radius. The correction vector is the difference between the tangent point and the last position of the
			point mass. Finally, we update the position of the point mass based on the last position and correction vector position
			= last_position + v_correct * (1.0 - friction).
		</p>
		<p>
			To implement Plane::collide, we will first use both the current position and the last position of the point mass to
			subtract the point in the plane to get two vectors. We will calculate the dot products of both vector with the plane
			norm. The product of both dot product is non-positive, we can say that the point mass cross the plane. Thus, we will
			move the point mass back by current_cross values, and the direction is along the plane normal. The correction vector
			will have the opposite sign against current_cross. Finally, we update the position of the point mass based on the last
			position and correction vector position = last_position + v_correct * (1.0 - friction).

		<p>
			The low ks value will make the cloth fit the sphere better, and as the ks increases, the cloth will gradually become
			harder to deform, the folds will be reduced, and the sides of the static position will be more warped.
		</p>

		<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>
			In this part, we implement the self-collision for the cloth model using spatial hashing. For each point mass, we will
			put it into a array that is mapped from a float number in a hash map. All these point masses are located in a 3D volumn
			box represented by the floating number they mapped from. To check if the object collide with itself, we will iterate
			through all the point masses. For each point mass, we all also iterate through the point mass within the same 3D volumn
			box as the original one to check if any other point mass exist within 2 * thickness distance from the original point
			mass. If so, we will say that a self-collision at the point mass occur and the position of the point mass need to be
			corrected. This implementation can imporve the time complexity and save a lot of loops while checking self-collision.

		<p>
			Similar to what we have in part 3, we can see that if the density of the cloth is small, the cloth will have a more
			detailed simulation effect when the cloth is falling onto itself. As density becomes larger, the bottom portion of the
			cloth will have more fine folds. When the density is small, there is only a small number of point mass for the object
			per unit volumn , a lot of detailed folds and movements will be ignored as low density point mass cannot include all the
			complex effects between multiple point masses. However, as density grows, we will be able to get enough point mass to
			simulate more complicate physical effects.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, for the changes related to the spring constant, when the constant is small, we will also be able to see
			more detailed folds since only apply a small amount of force will be able to cause a greate deforms to the cloth. As
			spring constant is getting larger, the cloth will getting harder to be deformed and a lot of folds will disappear in the
			simulation.
		</p>
		<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<p>
			In this part, we implemented a GLSL shader which an be used to run independently on GPU to isolate some parts of
			graphics pipeline to shade components. Given some texture information, for instance, a texture file, a shader will
			output a single 4D vector that will be used to add texture to fregaments and vectors. A fragment shader will be used
			after we get the results from a rasterizer.It will be used to calculate the color of the fragements. A vector shader
			will be used to modify the position and the normal vector of geometric components. It will do vector and matrix
			operations to vertices. By combining these two shaders together, we will be able to simulate different lighting and
			material effects on obejcts.
