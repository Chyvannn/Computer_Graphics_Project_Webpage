		<p>
			In this assignment, we implement the algorithms that can be used in geometric modeling. Starting from the Bezier curve
			using de Casteljau’s algorithm in 2D space, we extend it into 3D space to implement Bezier surface. Then, building upon
			these ideas, in order to smoothen the flat shading showed in our blender implementation, we add support to the
			area-weighted normal vectors. To have a better control over the triangle mesh, we implement edge flip and edge split in
			our blender. These methods are built upon the half-edge data structure in which every edge except the boundary will have
			its twin in their neighbor triangle, and each each is combined with two half-edges. Furthermore, with the edge flip and
			split, we will be able to implement mesh upsampling using loop subdivision to subdivide the triangles, insert new mesh
			elements, and update old elements based on weighting scheme.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the implementation, we were impressed by the process of deriving Bezier curve and the usage of half-edge data
			structure. They provided a great way to interpret geometrical models. We also enjoy the last part of the project in
			implementing loop subdivision. We see how a cube can be gradually changed into a ball-like shape. In summary, this
			project gave us insight on how a blender work.
		</p>
		<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

		<p>
			Casteljau's algorithm is used to draw a Bezier curve starting from the points provided. We split the line of every
			two points using the given ratio t. We insert new points at the split and use these newly added splitting points as new
			starting points and call Casteljau's algorithm again. The algorithm will stop when only one point remains. The
			trajectory of this point as t changes from 0 to 1 is a Bezier curve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementation: Since evaluateStep(...) only call one layer of the Casteljau's algorithm, we just need to iterate
			through the points and using vector-scalar calculation to get a new point. The general equation is new_point = t *
			point_1 + (1 - t) * point_2. Since the initial points are provided as a C++ vector and the result will also be a
			vector, we will each new points to a new_points vector and use this vector to enter a new Casteljau's algorithm.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are 6 points we add to generate the new bezier curve: (0.10, 0.10), (0.10, 0.50), (0.50, 0.70), (0.70, 0.45),
			(0.20, 0.20), (0.50, 0.50). The images below are each step during evaluation along with a gif of mmodified points
			with changing t.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

		<p>
			The de Casteljau algorithm extended to Bezier surface can be broke into two parts. With a 2D vector is points, we
			evaluate each row of the vector to get a Bezier curve for the current row. If a NxN 2D vector is given, after the
			first step, we will be able to get n Bezier curves. Then, we will use the final point we insert in for each Bezier curve
			to evaluate a new Bezier curve cross all n Bezier curves we evaluate in the previous step. The surface swept by this
			line is the Bezier surface we evaluate from these NxN points.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the actual implementation, we use break these steps into three functions. evaluateStep() is slightly different
			from the one we built in task 1. Since we are evaluating a surface, the points are Vector3D. This function will
			evaluate one step of the de Casteljau algorithm and output the points for next step. evaluate1D() is a function that
			recursively call evaluateStep(). It will take one row of the NxN vector and directly return the final point
			calculated from de Casteljau's algorithm. evaluate() takes in the t-values we will used in de Casteljau's algorithm on
			x and y direction and a `NxN` vector. It first call evaluate1D() on each row and use the results to call
			evaluate1D() again to get the final surface.
		</p>
		<p>Here is the teapot we get after this part.</p>

		<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

		<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
		<p>
			To calculate the area weighted normal, we first want to iterate through the triangles around the current vertex.
			Thus, we use the do{...}while(h != h->twin()->next); iteration method provided in doc to iterate through half-edges from
			the vertex.	
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing to not is that we also need to check if the face is a boundary.The function to calculate norm is provided in
			face class. To calculate the area of the triangle, we can use the dot product of two sides of the triangle. Then our
			task focus on getting the vectors of two sides. We use first half edge to get two vertex position of a triangle, since
			the vertex here is a iterator, we can simple use Vector3D vertex1 = v->position to get the first vertex position, and
			after v++, use the same line to get the second vertex position.
			Then, we switch to the next half-edge and get the last vertex, vertex3. At this point, we get all the vertex position
			for a neighbor triangle.
			After applying dot product on vertex3 - vertex2 and vertex1 - vertex2, we will be able to get the area of the neighbor
			triangle. After iterating through all the neighbor triangle and add norm * area, we divide the total weighted norm by
			the degree of the vertex to get the averaged weighted normal of the vertex.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
		<p>
			We first try to do a flipping only on that edge without modifying other mesh element, but it eventually failed. After
			referring back to project spec and lecture slides, we decided to follow the instruction to save relevant mesh elements
			first before flipping. We then get all the half-edge of two triangles, namely abc and cbd, that involved in flipping,
			change the half edge vertex b in abc is pointing to from bc to bd, and change c in cbd is pointing to from cb to ca.
			Then, we start set neighbors for the flipped triangles, changing them from abc and cbd to adc and dab. During this
			process, we will treat the middle edge e0 as bc and cb but they actually refers to the new edge ad and da.
		</p>
		<p>
			One bug we encountered during the implementation is that the half edge iterator we get from face by calling halfedge()
			were not always keep consistent. Thus, we will need to explicitly specify the half-edge each face is pointing before
			using them in setNeighbors(). The issue of halfedge() let us dig holes after pressing f. We will be able to see the mesh
			structure on the other side of the teapot through this hole. Determining the arguments passed into setNeighbors() is
			also a tricky part during the implementation. With wrong arguments, we will sometimes get a triangle hole or maybe a
			quadrangle hole after flip an edge.
		</p>
		<p>
			To help us debug the flip function, we draw out the flipping triangles and label each edge to help visualize the
			changes. We tried to print out a HalfEdgeIterator, but lack toString function to support this.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
		<p>
			The implementation for this part is similar to what we do in the previous part, and with the experience of task 4, we
			follow the advice in the spec to save all the relative mesh elements for slipping and draw a diagram before actually
			setting neighbors and reassigning the mesh elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			Different from what we do in task 4, this time we need to add a new midpoint vertex m on the splitting edge along
			with 6 new half-edges (mb/bm, mc/cm, md/dm), and 3 new edges, and 2 new faces (amc, cmd). By labeling these new elements
			in the diagram, we only have one argument mismatching during our final debugging. The bug rendering image we got after
			split was similar to the one we got in task 4, a hole is generated after splitting and we can see the mesh on the other
			side of the teapot through this black hole. After we check step by step with the diagram we draw and the function calls,
			we fix this bug by changing the twin argument in the setNeighbors().

		<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
		<p>
			We also handled the case in which the splitting edge is a boundary. Since the boundary edge has nothing pointing to on
			the other side after split, we do need to adjust new mesh elements created for not boundary case and also change the
			arguments in setNeighbors() to support this.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>
			For this part, we followed the possible solution provided in student_code to implement the upsampe(). We first compute
			the new positions of all old vertices in the triangle mesh using the predetermined weighting schemes provided in spec
			and store them into Vertex::newPosition. Then, we calculate the new positions for those newly inserted vertices which
			are connected by edges that will do edge flip in the later part and also load them into Vertex::Position. While doing
			the above computation, we will also keep a flag to mark all the old vertices along with their edges. After that, we will
			split every edge of the triangle mesh and store the new position of the those midpoint vertices in Vertex::newPosition.
			Then, we will flip each edge that connect an old vertex and a new vertex. Finally, we will use the saved new position to
			update the position of each vertex.

			We can see that after doing the loop subdivision, the edge and corner of the meshes will become less sharp and more
			smooth. Cube is the most obvious example of this effect. Here is how a cube change with loop subdivision. To keep the
			overall feature of a cube, we can do some pre-splitting on some edges of the cube. Here are two different examples of
			pre-splitting I did to the cube.

			The asymmetric behavior is due to the triangle mesh on each surface of the cube. There are only two triangles on each
			side of the cube. During loop subdivision, the orientation of these triangles will cause some effect similar to
			polarization and make the cube asymmetric. To fix this, we can do pre-splitting on each side as follow.

			For this extra credit, we first follow the tutorial and create a block-man figure in the latest version of blender, but
			we found that the .dae file cannot be openned in project. Thus, we changed to the previous version of the blender, but
