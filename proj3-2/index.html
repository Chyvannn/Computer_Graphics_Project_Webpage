		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project, we extended what we do in project 3-1 and implement the support to the reflection and refraction image
			and also the microfacet model, which corresponding to part 1 and part 2. The coding is straightfoward with algorithms
			and tips provided in the spec. One of the major issue we faced is that when we are implementing part 1 task 4, we used
			cos_theta instead of abs_cos_theta which result in black dots on the sphere. 
		</p>
		<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
		<p>
			In this part, we implement the mirror and glass models by stimulating the reflection and fraction effects. For
			reflection, we can do a symmetric transformation with z axis to get direction wi. For refraction, after checking total
			internal reflection, we use the pesudocode provided to calcuate teh refracted light. Finally, for glass material, we
			first check if total internal reflection occur. If it does, we will only do reflection on wo. Otherwise, we use
			Schlick's reflection coefficient R to do a coin flip to mix the reflect and refract effects together.

		<ul>
			<li>
				The image we get with max depth from 0 to 4 are different, but from 5 to 100 are the same.
			</li>
			<li>
				Whenmax depth is 0, the image we got only contains direct light from the source and only the light source is rendered.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 1, the image start showing the reflections, surrounding walls are also lighted up due to one bounce
				light, but the ceiling is still dark except the light source. We can also see the specular reflection and the shadow of
				both spheres. However, the majority of both spheres are still dark since they need to reflect/refract light from the
				surrounding walls but only one bounce light is allowed. It is not possible to have refraction in this case.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 2, the ceiling is lit up and the left sphere can also get deffuse reflected lights from the
				surrounding walls. However, the ceiling can still not properly be reflected on the left sphere since it requires at
				least 3 bounces. For the right sphere, there is a lot of black dots which makes the sphere almost dark. The refraction
				can not be properly rendered since only 2 bounces are allowed, most light refracted into the glass sphere will not be
				able to get out. The reflection of the right sphere on the left sphere is not properly rendered since it requires at
				lease 4 bounce. The shadow of both sphere is softer with more surrounding light.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 3, the ceiling reflection on the left sphere is lit up. The refraction on the right sphere is properly
				rendered. There is a bright spot on the floor under the right sphere which is light refracted twice onto the floor with
				3 bounces. The reflection of the right sphere on the left sphere is still dark.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 4, the reflection of the right sphere is lit up on the left sphere. There is also a bright spot on the
				right wall which is refracted from the righ sphere with 4 bounce.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth > 4, the image is almost the same.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Material</h2>
		<p>
			In this part, we implemented the Microfacet model and support isotropic rough conductors that only reflect. We use NDF
			describe how the microfacets's normals are distributed and use Beckmann distribution to evalute the overall
			distribution. We then implement Fresnel term to evaluate the color information. Finally, we implement importance
			sampling to sample theta and omega using PDFs and combine them with get the sampling result.

		</div>
		<p>
			When we change the alpha value of the .dae file, we can see that the roughness of the rendered material image is also
			changing. As we increase the alpha value, the overall color and the reflection effects will be changing. When alpha is
			0.005, we can see that the rendered dragon is almost black and the specular reflection is also weak in the middle part
			of the dragon body. When we change alpha value to 0.5 gradually, we can see that the overall color is getting lighter.
			The specular reflection part will also become wider. Small alpha value will have result in greater PDF and NDF which
			means that the environment will have greater effects on the object and the sampling range is wide. As alpha increase,
			the surroundings will have less impact on the obejct and the sampling range will be smaller.

		</div>
		<p>
			The cosin hemisphere sampling will result in the rendered bunny with more noise and white dots. The bunny is more
			grandular when the one rendered using importance sampling. The oveall color of importance sampled bunny will be darker
			than the one rendered with cosin hemisphere sampling. Impoartance sampling in this case can reduce he roughness of the
			image.

		<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
		<p>
			This project is fairly straightfoward, each of us just complete one part of the project. Everything went well. When one
			of us encountered some issue in our own part, the other one will always give some help. In this project, we learned how
			to render the glass material and using reflection adn refraction to make the material more realistic. We also learned
			different materials are represented while rendering.
