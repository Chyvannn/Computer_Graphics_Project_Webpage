		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project we extend what we did in project 3-2 and implement additional support for our path tracer, including
			reflection and refraction effects on mirror and glass material (part 1), and microfacet material (part 2). After
			implementing part 1, with the combination of reflection and refraction, we were able to render realistic images which
			have light passing throught the glass material and shooting on the walls, and simulate the deformation of the
			surrounding environment in a spherical mirror. After implementing part 2, we were able to render images of different
			conductive materials based on their refraction indices.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of the issues we encountered during the implementation, we took a long time debugging the glass material
			rendering. The coin flip and the calculation of Schlick's reflection coefficient R is tricky. We first use reflection
			for the 1-R (refraction) case and resulted in two mirror spheres. Then, we found that using purly cos_theta when
			calculating R resulted in a glass sphere with a lot of black dots. This issue was finally solved by using abs_cos_theta
			instead.
		</p>
		<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
		<p>
			In this part, we implement the mirror and glass models by stimulating the reflection and fraction effects. For
			reflection, since the origin is our intersection point and z-axis has the same direction as our normal vector, all the
			transformation about the light direction is in the xy plane. We can simply do a symmetric transformation for wo along
			z-axis to get wi. The outgoing light becomes (-x, -y, z) if the incomming light is (x, y, z).
		</p>
		<p>
			For refraction, we treat x, y, z as functions of two angluar values theta and phi. Since entering and exiting materials
			will have different index of refraction, we also check z value of wo to choose the correct eta and sign which will be
			used to calculate wi later. After checking if total internal reflection will happen, we use the pesudocode provided to
			calculate the refracted light wi which applies the eta we get from ior and the incomming light wo. One thing to note is
			that the z value of wi will have different sign as wo since the surface of our intersaction is at origin and wo and wi
			will be pointing at two opposite direction of this surface.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, for glass material, we choose the algorithms by checking if the total internal reflection would occur. If total
			inter reflection wil happen under the current setting, we can only use reflection function to get wi which is already
			implemented in the previous part. Otherwise, we will need to combine both the reflection and refaction to render the
			object. In this case, we first calculate the Schlick's reflection coefficient R which simulate a simple version of
			fresnel equations. R and 1-R cooresponding to the distribution of lights that result in reflection and refraction
			respectively. For reflection (R term), we use the reflection function we implement in the previous part and set PDF to
			R. For refraction (1-R) term, we use the refraction function we implemented in the previous part and set PDF to 1-R.
			This randomlized sampling process let us combine these effects together to get a realistic glass material image.

		<ul>
			<li>
				The image we get with max depth from 0 to 4 are different, but from 5 to 100 are the same.
			</li>
			<li>
				Whenmax depth is 0, the image we got only contains direct light from the source and only the light source is rendered.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 1, the image start showing the reflections, surrounding walls are also lighted up due to one bounce
				light, but the ceiling is still dark except the light source. We can also see the specular reflection and the shadow of
				both spheres. However, the majority of both spheres are still dark since they need to reflect/refract light from the
				surrounding walls but only one bounce light is allowed. It is not possible to have refraction in this case.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 2, the ceiling is lit up and the left sphere can also get deffuse reflected lights from the
				surrounding walls. However, the ceiling can still not properly be reflected on the left sphere since it requires at
				least 3 bounces. For the right sphere, there is a lot of black dots which makes the sphere almost dark. The refraction
				can not be properly rendered since only 2 bounces are allowed, most light refracted into the glass sphere will not be
				able to get out. The reflection of the right sphere on the left sphere is not properly rendered since it requires at
				lease 4 bounce. The shadow of both sphere is softer with more surrounding light.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 3, the ceiling reflection on the left sphere is lit up. The refraction on the right sphere is properly
				rendered. There is a bright spot on the floor under the right sphere which is light refracted twice onto the floor with
				3 bounces. The reflection of the right sphere on the left sphere is still dark.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth is 4, the reflection of the right sphere is lit up on the left sphere. There is also a bright spot on the
				right wall which is refracted from the righ sphere with 4 bounce.
			</li>
			<li>
				When max depth > 4, the image is almost the same.

		<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Material</h2>
		<p>
			In this part, we implemented the Microfacet model and support isotropic rough conductors that only reflect. We use NDF
			describe how the microfacets's normals are distributed and use Beckmann distribution to evalute the overall
			distribution. We then implement Fresnel term to evaluate the color information. Finally, we implement importance
			sampling to sample theta and omega using PDFs and combine them with get the sampling result.

			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			When we change the alpha value of the .dae file, we can see that the roughness of the rendered material image is also
			changing. As we increase the alpha value, the overall color and the reflection effects will be changing. When alpha is
			0.005, we can see that the rendered dragon is almost black and the specular reflection is also weak in the middle part
			of the dragon body. When we change alpha value to 0.5 gradually, we can see that the overall color is getting lighter.
			The specular reflection part will also become wider. Small alpha value will have result in greater PDF and NDF which
			means that the environment will have greater effects on the object and the sampling range is wide. As alpha increase,
			the surroundings will have less impact on the obejct and the sampling range will be smaller.

		<p>
			The cosin hemisphere sampling will result in the rendered bunny with more noise and white dots. The bunny is more
			grandular when the one rendered using importance sampling. The oveall color of importance sampled bunny will be darker
			than the one rendered with cosin hemisphere sampling. Impoartance sampling in this case can reduce he roughness of the
			image.

		<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
		<p>
			In term of collaberation, we are each responsible for one part of this project. Since one of us M1 mac which cannot run
			the stuff solution provided in the project skeleton ,we use the live share feature in CLion instead to do the project
			together. This also let us keep up with each other's progress easily. In this project, one thing we learned and felt
			most impressive is how we deal with the glass material that encounters both reflection and refraction. The Schlick's
			reflection coefficient R uses a randomlized sampling process to stimulate the distribution of the light energy when
			interfere with surface of an object.
